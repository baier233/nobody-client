+ Some reasons I made it opensource
    1. Regarding the issue of TD.I accumulated a lot of shitcode in the early stage of the project. Now to implement some of my ideas, I am more inclined to recode a completely new project.
    2. I no longer have more energy to focus on Minecraft Hacking, so I prefer open source. When writing JNI cheat, I encountered many problems. Maybe you can find solutions to some problems here.

This project was developed by me on the basis of [skidware](https://github.com/Blqtent/Skidware-Inject). I am very grateful to the other two developers of skidware.

If you want to use it as a Client Base, consider choosing [Ripterm](https://github.com/Lefraudeur/RiptermsGhost).
